//
// This file tells TypeScript that the 'cytoscape-fcose' plugin exists.
// - Some libraries/plugins don't have their own type definitions.
// - Declaring the module like this lets you import and use it in TypeScript without errors.
// - You don't need to write types for the plugin's APIâ€”just let TypeScript know it exists.

declare module 'cytoscape-fcose';
